#### Fork Master Synchronization
1. Assuming main repo has been added as a remote named `upstream`
2. `git fetch upstream`
3. `git reset --hard upstream/master`
 
#### Fork Branch updation with master
1. Assuming `feature-branch` is checked out.
2. Run `git rebase master` to update your branch if it is behind `master`(local)
3. If conflicts arise fix them and run `git add *` and then `git rebase --continue`
